
Hi, one of my friend is asking me about my love life. I feel uncomfortable lying but also I don't want him to know my love life. I'm not sure what to do now...
How do you typically handle situations where you feel uncomfortable sharing personal information with others?
I don't know, I have no past experience. I just answered him without giving anyw details.
Have you always found it difficult to share details about yourself, or is this something that has developed recently?
No, I like to share my life and my story. But for this man, I know he's kinda crushing on me, but I have no feeling of him. I see him as a good friend. So I feel uncomfortable sharing my love life with him.
Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation before, where someone had feelings for you but you only saw them as a friend?
I had. For most of them, I just ignore their messages and pretend I don't understand. They kinda back off aftere a while. But for this pereticular man, I have known him since middle school. So I do not want just simply cut off our connections.
How would you describe your overall approach to maintaining relationships with others?
I'm kinda introverted on social media, I'm not sure when is the good time to start a conversation and what to talk about. But I actively invove any offline events where I could meet my friends and kept connection with them. I try my best to participate every club events
What do you enjoy the most about participating in club events and how do you feel it helps you maintain connections with your friends?
Goodbye!
Goodbye! Before you go, can you tell me what brings you the most joy in life?
